As an aspiring artist, I have many times tried to find or create 3D content for the stories I wanted to tell. This starts with having the right 3D models. However you quickly find out that you have only two options: spend hours searching for the perfect model on sites like [Sketchfab](http://sketchfab.com) or  spend weeks/months learning a 3D Graphics tool like [Blender](http://blender.org).  Neither is particular appealing.

Any concept I have starts with a sketch. Hand-drawing is one of the easiest ways of communicating ideas. So what if I could turn my hand-drawn doodles to a 3D model? After all we humans can infer shapes from sketches. Now, as a research scientist, this is a problem I can investigate.

# What?

The Sketch2Shape looks into how 3D models can be generated from hand-drawn sketches.  As a research scientist working at the intersection of Graphics, Vision & Machine Learning, I use the latest techniques in these fields.  The main objective is an AI that outputs a 3D volumetric mesh, given as input an image of  a hand-drawn sketch.  For this to happend we need:

* Part 1 -  A training dataset consisting for pairs of sketches and meshes.
* Part 2 -  A generative neural network model that will produce the right mesh given a sketch


# Who?

Just me, Flora Tasse. I hold a PhD in Computer Graphics/Vision from the University of Cambridge where I worked on an AI agent, Shape2Vec that retrieves the right 3D model from a database given queries such sketches, photos, depth maps or other 3D models.  Check out this [SIGGRAPH Asia '16 paper](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/shape2vec/)if you want to learn out we use semantic information to achieve that.

Now, I lead the technological endeavors of [Selerio](http://selerio.io) where we reconstruct 3D contextual scenes from videos for more immersive and magical AR experiences.

As for where I come from, Cameroon is my motherland and where my dream for merging the real and the virtual started.

#  Part 1-  A Sketch-to-Shape dataset

Because generating dataset is time-consuming and resources-draining, I decided to build on top of existing datasets. There is no dataset of pairs of sketches  and meshes. But we can use edge detection and Graphics rendering techniques to create computer-generated sketches from 3D meshes.  

However computer-generated sketches are quite different from hand-drawn sketches. The latter are more complex, less structured and can vastly vary from one user to another based on style and skills.  So we need to link our computer-generated sketches to hand-drawn sketches. Luckily image similarity is a well-understood problem in Vision and we will use deep features generated from a Convolutional neural network to match a dataset of hand-drawn sketches to our own computer-generated sketches from a mesh dataset.

We will use these two existing datasets:

* [Shapenet Core](https://www.shapenet.org/) a dataset of 48,600 single clean 3D models covering 55 common object categories, from Stanford University. In particular we will use a version of this dataset where models are represented by 256^3 voxels. This version is obtained from the [ICCV'17 Shape Reconstruction Challenge](https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/iccv17/)

* [Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data): a dataset of 50 million drawings from the Google Quick Draw project.
