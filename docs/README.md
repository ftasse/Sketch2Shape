As an aspiring artist, I have many times tried to find or create 3D content for the stories I wanted to tell. This starts with having the right 3D models. However you quickly find out that you have only two options: spend hours searching for the perfect model on sites like Sketchfab or  spend weeks/months learning a 3D Graphics tool like Blender.  Neither is particular appealing.

Any concept I have starts with a sketch. Hand-drawing is one of the easiest ways of communicating ideas. So what if I could turn my hand-drawn doodles to a 3D model? After all we humans can infer shapes from sketches. Now, as a research scientist, this is a problem I can investigate.

<!--   To day sketches from  Quick draw   -->  

# What?
The Sketch2Shape looks into how 3D models can be generated from hand-drawn sketches.  As a research scientist working at the intersection of Graphics, Vision & Machine Learning, I use the latest techniques in these fields.  The main objective is an AI that outputs a 3D volumetric mesh, given as input an image of  a hand-drawn sketch.  For this to happend we need:

* Part 1 -  A training dataset consisting for pairs of sketches and meshes.
* Part 2 -  A generative neural network model that once trained, will produce the right mesh given a sketch


# Who?

Just me, Flora Tasse. I hold a PhD in Computer Graphics/Vision from the University of Cambridge when I worked on an AI agent, Shape2Vec that retrieves the right 3D model from a database given queries such sketches, photos, depth maps or other 3D models.  Check out this SIGGRAPH Asia '16 paper if you want to learn out we use semantic information to achieve that.

Now, I lead the technological endeavors of Selerio where we reconstruct 3D contextual scenes from videos for more immersive and magical AR experiences.

As for where I come from, Cameroon is my motherland and where my dream for merging the real and the virtual started.
